# Take Home Front-end Challenge
We at Spawning want to help you put your best foot forward when it comes to technical interviews. We believe the best method for this is a take-home exercise where you can work at your own pace and availability without the added stress of someone hovering over your shoulder.

Our goal is to get a better idea of how you deconstruct problems, prepare for future requirements, and ensure quality and stability. We are primarily evaluating this project on code quality and organization.

We are also evaluating this project, to a lesser degree, on UI and design. We don't expect an incredible user experience, but we expect a relatively professional interface.

## Guidelines
* We understand we're asking you to work on this in your personal time, and we want to respect that time. Please dedicate no more than 3 hours to your implementation. Feel free to spend as much time planning/brainstorming before you start coding.
* Please use React and JavaScript (or TypeScript) as the primary framework and language in your submission. Other libraries (Redux, Material-UI, Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc) are allowed but not required.
* Neither unit tests nor documentation are required for your submission, though they are bonuses.
* It's not necessary to deploy and host your project, but it would be a bonus.
* If you are unable to complete the task within the specified time, submit the project in the current state. Be prepared to discuss where you spent most of your time, difficulties encountered, etc.
* If you have extra time remaining, please be mindful of the time spent towards implementing the primary features versus time spent on additional features (if any).

## The Problem
We want you to implement a small e-commerce app. This app should contain the following features:
* A page which lists products from the provided **products.json** file.
* Users should be able to search the list of products by name.
* Products can be added to a shopping cart. It's not necessary for the shopping cart to persist between sessions.
* The items in the shopping cart do not need to be visible to the user, but the *number of items* and *total price* of the shopping cart should be displayed to the user.

## Submission
* Please submit your code to us at least 2 days before your scheduled interview. The calendar link has a field for the URL to the project code.
* Either send us a link to a public Github repository, or a link to the project as a ZIP file stored in a third party storage service (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc).
* Please include brief instructions on building/running the app in a **README.md** if special instructions are needed.
* Feel free to reach out to us. We will be happy to answer any clarifying questions about the prompt.
