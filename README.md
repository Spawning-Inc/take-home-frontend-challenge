# Take Home Front-end Challenge
We at Spawning want to help you put your best foot forward when it comes to technical interviews. We believe the best method for this is a take-home exercise where you can work at your own pace and availability without the added stress of someone hovering over your shoulder.

Our goal is to get a better idea of how you deconstruct problems, prepare for future requirements, and ensure quality and stability. We are primarily evaluating this project on code quality and organization.

We are also evaluating this project, to a lesser degree, on UI and design. We don't expect an incredible user experience, but we expect a relatively professional interface.

## Guidelines
* We understand we're asking you to work on this in your personal time, and we want to respect that time. Please dedicate no more than 3 hours to your implementation. Feel free to spend as much time planning/brainstorming before you start coding.
* Please use React and JavaScript (or TypeScript) as the primary framework and language in your submission. Other libraries (Redux, Material-UI, Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc) are allowed but not required.
* Neither units tests nor documentation are required for your submission, though they are bonuses.
* It's not necessary to deploy and host your project, but it would be a bonus.

## The Problem
We want you to implement a small e-commerce app. This app should contain the following features:
* A page which lists products from the provided **products.json** file.
* Users should be able to search the list of products by name.
* Products can be added to a shopping cart. It's not necessary for the shopping cart to persist between sessions.
* The items in the shopping cart do not need to be visible to the user, but the *number of items* and *total price* of the shopping cart should be displayed to the user.

## Submission
* Please submit your code to us at least 2 days before your scheduled interview.
* You can either send us a link to a public Github repository, or send us a ZIP file of your project.
* Please include brief instructions on building/running the app in a **README.md**.
* Feel free to reach out to us. We will be happy to answer any clarifying questions about the prompt.
